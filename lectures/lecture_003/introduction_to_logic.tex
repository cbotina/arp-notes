\section{Introduction to Logic}
\label{sec:introduction-logic}

Logic is key for representing human thinking and building systems that emulate thought processes. It's a tool for explaining knowledge based on reasoning elements: categories, definitions, judgments, and propositions. From Aristotle to today, logic has evolved into a powerful tool for modeling behavior in AI.

Logic is a \textbf{formal science} (not empirical). \textbf{Formal sciences} like logic and mathematics work with abstract structures, symbols, and inference rules through \textbf{deductive} reasoning—starting from axioms and deriving conclusions via formal rules, no empirical observation needed. \textbf{Empirical sciences} like physics and biology observe the world and test hypotheses through experimentation using \textbf{inductive} reasoning. Logic studies the \textbf{structure of reasoning itself}, focusing on abstract relationships and formal rules, regardless of whether statements are actually true in reality.

Logic enables \textbf{formal representation of relationships} between objects and their properties, useful for emulating human thinking, modeling AI behavior, and identifying valid reasoning patterns.

\textbf{Aristotle} is considered the father of logic. He developed the \textbf{syllogism}—two premises leading to one conclusion. Example: "All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal."
