\subsection*{Key Concepts Summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Decision Making}: Understanding decision complexity, elements involved (future effect, reversibility, impact, quality, periodicity), and classification of decisions and problems.
    
    \item \textbf{Problem Solving Stages}: Three-stage approach: (1) Understand the problem's complexity through identification and explanation techniques, (2) Create a strategy by defining, choosing, and designing, (3) Solve by implementing, evaluating, and refining.
    
    \item \textbf{Intelligent Agents}: Autonomous and rational entities that perceive their environment through sensors (Feel), reason and decide using deliberative processes (Think), and execute actions through actuators (Act).
    
    \item \textbf{Agent Architectures}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Deliberative}: Maintain internal world models and perform explicit reasoning (e.g., Planning agents, BDI)
        \item \textit{Reactive}: Direct stimulus-response without world models (e.g., Subsumption, Agent networks)
        \item \textit{Hybrid}: Combine deliberative and reactive approaches (e.g., PRS, COSY)
        \item \textit{Cognitive}: Model human cognitive processes with memory systems (e.g., ACT-R, SOAR)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
